// Shared by every repo that consumes the org baseline. Only standard Rector
// rules, so it needs no extra dependency: maho's own .rector.php (with the
// Maho\Rector\* rules and the Varien->Maho migration) stays in maho and is not
// synced. Only the paths that exist in a given repo are scanned, so the one
// config works for app-only modules and the infra tool's src/ alike.
//
// Existence alone is not enough: in a module repo `composer install` lets the
// maho composer plugin materialize maho core files under public/ and lib/.
// Those files are never tracked by the module. Some modules git-ignore them,
// some ignore the whole directory, and some leave them untracked next to their
// own tracked skin or js files. Rector must not lint core files a module cannot
// change, so every path git does not track is skipped. Without
// --exclude-standard, ls-files lists ignored files as well as plain untracked
// ones, and --directory collapses a fully untracked directory to one entry.

    //    rewrite, so a repo that declares no require.php floor (such as
    //    maho-composer-plugin) would ship code its own metadata never promised.
    //    A composer plugin also runs on the user's PHP, not on the platform the
    //    project resolved against.
    //  - ReadOnlyClass / ReadOnlyProperty change the contract, not the code: a
    //    readonly class cannot be extended by a normal child, and a readonly
    //    property cannot be written from one. Maho modules exist to be extended.
    //
    // Everything else in the sets is a safe rewrite, so keep the derivation.
